hold your bags, bois
--------------------

Bagfolio is a bunch of scripts to keep track of your shitcoin portfolio. It's
not finished yet but as no one is going to use it anyways who cares.

To start checkout this repo and run ./nukedb
Then call ./buy to add buy transactions to your shitfolio.
./sell is for sales.
./bags will print a performance summary.

I wish I could include a screenshot here but I don't trust markdown. That's
why you have to manually click on screenshot.png to see this thing in all of
its glory.
